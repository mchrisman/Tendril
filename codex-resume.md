# Codex Session Resume

## What we’ve done so far

- Diagnosed and fixed the special `remainder?` idiom in the engine’s object-spread logic.
- Added a regression test for `@r=(remainder?)` binding multiple residual keys.
- Updated the Tendril factory to enforce string-only patterns.
- Moved legacy test scripts from the project root into `test/legacy/`.
- Updated the test script in `package.json` to include nested test paths (`test/**/*.js`).

## Remaining work

1. Audit and clean up legacy tests in `test/legacy/`: remove or convert silently failing or outdated tests.
2. Consolidate all meaningful tests under a unified `test/` directory structure.
3. Identify and remove empty or non-asserting test files.
4. Ensure the main `npm test` command runs only the active test suite.
5. Review test coverage and prune or rewrite tests based on the current v4 language spec.
