## CW 6. Recursive descent

A breadcrumb path is really just an array of instructions for navigating somewhere else in the structure.

We already have p.**.q indicating remote ancestry. This works only for the simple case of chained parent-child relationships. It is equivalent to `p(._)*.q` -- We are already treating this path as a **pattern on the array of navigation instructions**.

This could be generalized to navigations other than simple keyed/indexed child descent.

For example, what if you wanted to find a cycle in a directed graph like `[ [$from,$to]* ]`?

Introduce a descent rule syntax `**↳($from, $to where PATTERN )` Which for this directed graph example would be
`↳($a,$b where $b=($a[1]))`

Then a cyclic graph is `[... $start.**↳($a,$b where $b=($a[1])):$start) ...]`

(You don't need to point out that this particular example would be very inefficient, and that we'd need a 'visited' flag and a depth limit, and that this is a complication to the language that is prima facie unjustified. )
