We are going to force grow this into an evolved, production-ready system that maintains its lightweight nature,  and ease of use, and unique syntax, with

- Smoothed out ergonomics (carefully, carefully)
- A polished test harness and a thorough set of unit tests.
- Impressive optimization using ideas from miniKanren, Prolog, and Dataflow constraint solvers. A power tool, not a toy, but not trying to be something it isn't.
- A clarified and well chosen market niche (not to change its current positioning so much as to clarify in what manner we need to smooth the ergonomics, and what optimizations to focus on).
- Powerful debugging tools.
- A brand new codebase designed for extensibility and elegance.
